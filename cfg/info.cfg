echo heya, thank you for downloading this alpha, but we have bad news for anyone expecting things from this alpha


echo this alpha is discontinued: yes we have stopped working on this version of the alpha, however the game is not DEAD
echo we have just decided to move to a new engine, the Unreal Engine™ 4, the game is also now called "The Misadventures of Jason" (name is placeholder.)

echo however thank you again for trying out this relic of an alpha, and ya don't need to ask to use this as a template to make your own Half Life 2™ sourcemod! 


echo everything used in the game belongs to their rightful owners and are left in as an archive, most assets were never ment to be used in the final game, and are not going to be used in the UE4 version of the game, thank you for being here since 2019 and i hope to see you all on UE4!
